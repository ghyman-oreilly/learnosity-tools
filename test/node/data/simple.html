<p>[Correct Answer] C. It allows applications to run consistently across different environments.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>D. It allows you to manage and monitor cloud resources.</p>
</div>
<p>[Rationales]</p>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>A. Containerization does not involve creating physical servers. See Module 3, “What Technical Skills Does a Cloud Engineer Need to Have?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>B. Containerization may be related to virtualizing compute and data resources, but typically, virtual machines are not built into containers. See Module 3, “What Technical Skills Does a Cloud Engineer Need to Have?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>C. Containerization packages applications and their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across different environments. See Module 3, “What Technical Skills Does a Cloud Engineer Need to Have?”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>D. Containerization is a technology that builds applications into containers hosted on a cloud computing platform. It is not used to monitor cloud resources. See Module 3, “What Technical Skills Does a Cloud Engineer Need to Have?”</p>
