</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>B. It eliminates the need for budgeting.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>[Correct Answer] C. It can lead to unpredictable expenses.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>D. It guarantees fixed monthly costs.</p>
</div>
<p>[Rationales]</p>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>A. While cloud computing can reduce costs, it does not always do so. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>B. Budgeting is still necessary in cloud computing. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>C. Cloud computing costs can vary based on usage, leading to unpredictable expenses. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>D. Cloud costs are typically variable, not fixed. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>

<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>A. Increased deployment time raised capital expenditures, limited collaboration, and worsened disaster recovery.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>B. Cloud computing does not have any significant impact on businesses and IT operations.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>[Correct Answer] C. Cloud computing helped in creating opportunities for cloud engineering career jobs. It also creates rapid deployment, reduces capital expenditures for IT, enhances collaboration, and helps in improved disaster recovery.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>D. Cloud computing is primarily AI-assisted agents and copilots, leading to no increased demand of cloud engineers to work with the cloud today.</p>
</div>
<p>[Rationales]</p>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>A. Cloud computing typically speeds up deployment, lowers capital expenditures, and enhances disaster recovery. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>B. Cloud computing has had a significant positive impact on businesses and IT operations. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>C. Cloud computing helps create various cloud engineering opportunities. It also enables rapid deployment, reduces capital IT expenditures, enhances collaboration, and improves disaster recovery. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>D. Cloud computing is not solely focused on AI technologies. Furthermore, the increase in cloud services requires more skilled cloud engineers, not less, to manage the complexities and opportunities offered by cloud solutions. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>

<div data-custom-style="QuestionStem">
<p>2. What is vendor lock-in in the context of cloud computing?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>A. The ability to switch between cloud providers easily</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>[Correct Answer] B. The dependency on a single cloud provider’s service</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>C. The use of multiple cloud providers simultaneously</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>D. The implementation of open source cloud solutions</p>
</div>
<p>[Rationales]</p>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>A. Vendor lock-in refers to the difficulty of switching providers, not the ease. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>B. Vendor lock-in occurs when a business becomes dependent on one cloud provider, making it challenging to switch to another provider without significant costs or disruptions. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>C. Using multiple cloud providers is known as a multicloud strategy. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>D. Open source solutions aim to reduce vendor lock-in. See Module 1, “The Evolution of Cloud Computing.”</p>
