<p>Which of the following is true?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>[Correct Answer] A. In functional programming, <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">map</span> behaves like an imperative loop, and <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">filter</span> behaves like an imperative <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">if</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>B. In functional programming, <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">map</span> behaves like an imperative <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">if</span>, and <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">filter</span> behaves like an imperative loop.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>C. In imperative programming, <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">map</span> behaves like a functional loop, and <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">filter</span> behaves like a functional <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">if</span>.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>A. The <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">map</span> function "iterates" over all values in a list, and the <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">filter</span> function checks to see if a particular condition is true. See “Imperative and Functional Programming Languages.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>B. An imperative <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">if</span> uses a Boolean expression, but a <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">map</span> function doesn't necessarily involve a Boolean expression. See “Imperative and Functional Programming Languages.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>C. Functional programming uses recursion instead of loops. So, there isn't really a "functional loop." See “Imperative and Functional Programming Languages.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionStem">
<p>In the imperative programming style, we combine statements by performing them one after another, by performing them upon checking an <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">if</span> condition, or by repeating them in a loop. How do we combine evaluations of functions in the functional programming style?</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>[Correct Answer] A. We take the result of evaluating one function and make that result an argument for evaluating the next function.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>B. We filter each function's input.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>C. We apply functions to one another in the order in which they're defined in the program.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionOption">
<p>D. We use each function's result as an argument to every other function.</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>For example, to find the sum of all food purchases, we take the result of filtering the <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">purchaseList</span> for <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">hasCategoryFood</span>, and make that result be an argument to the <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">map</span> function. See “Imperative and Functional Programming Languages.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>Some functional programming doesn't involve filtering. For example, we may want to find the sum of all purchases, not only purchases satisfying the <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">hasCategoryFood</span> condition. See “Imperative and Functional Programming Languages.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>The order in which functions are defined in the program doesn't matter. We apply functions in the order in which they need to be evaluated in order to get the desired result. See “Imperative and Functional Programming Languages.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>We don't use every function's result as an argument to every other function. For example, in calculating the sum of food purchase amounts, we don't sum up the purchases themselves. Instead, we sum up the amounts of those particular purchases. We apply the <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">map</span> function with <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">getAmount</span> before performing the sum.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>The <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">filter</span> function finds the even numbers. Then the <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">total</span> function sums up the even numbers. See “Imperative and Functional Programming Languages.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>With imperative coding, statements are executed in the order in which they appear. In this code fragment, we're trying to print the <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">total</span> before we've calculated the value of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">total</span>.

<p>In some situations, the greedy method works. For example, in US coinage, you can form any amount by taking the largest valued coin first. To make 33 cents, you take a 25-cent coin (the largest denomination that's less than 33 cents), then a 5-cent coin (the largest denomination that's less than the remaining 9 cents), and then four 1-cent coins. The greedy method works for all amounts in almost all of the world's currencies. See “Testing, Debugging, and Memoization.”</p>

<p>During any iteration of the loop, we have two threads executing <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x = x + 1</span>. If both threads fetch the value of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> (on the right side of the assignment) before either thread has updated <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> (on the left side of the assignment), then the result from both threads is to add only 1 to <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span>. But if one thread updates <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> before the other thread fetches <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span>, the result from both threads is to add 2 to <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span>. So, the printed value of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> depends on how many times one thread updates before the other thread fetches. This can happen 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, or all 3 times. The resulting values of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> are 3, 4, 5, and 6.

<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>Outputs other than 6 may occur. For example, during the first iteration, both threads may fetch the value of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> (the value 0 on the right side of the assignment) before either thread has updated <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> (on the left side of the assignment). In that situation, both threads assign 1 to <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span>. If this happens during all three iterations, the value of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> goes from 0 to 1, then from 1 to 2, and finally from 2 to 3.

</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>Each of the three iterations results in an increment of either 1 or 2 to the value of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span>. So, the printed value of <span data-custom-style="Inline Code">x</span> is at least 3. See “Avoiding Race Conditions and Achieving Thread Safety.”</p>

<p>A race condition occurs when two or more agents attempt to modify a particular value at the same time. An impure function may modify the value of a variable that's referenced by code outside the function. The impure function and the code outside the function are two agents, both of which may modify the variable's value. So, a race condition may occur. See “Avoiding Race Conditions and Achieving Thread Safety.”</p>
</div>
<div data-custom-style="QuestionRationale">
<p>A race condition occurs when two or more agents attempt to modify a particular value at the same time.
